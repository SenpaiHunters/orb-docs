# ðŸ”® Orb Documentation ðŸ“‘

This repository contains the official documentation for [Orb](https://orb.net), an intelligent network monitoring platform that continuously measures internet experience. The documentation is published at [orb.net/docs](https://orb.net/docs).

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into several main sections:

- **Getting Started**: Introduction to Orb, quickstart guides, and basic concepts
- **Install Orb Apps**: Installation instructions for various platforms (iOS, Android, macOS, Windows)
- **Set Up an Orb Sensor**: Detailed guides for setting up dedicated sensors on multiple platforms
- **Using Orb Apps**: Comprehensive information about app interfaces, metrics, and account management

## Contributing to Documentation

We welcome contributions from the community to improve the Orb documentation. Here's how you can contribute:

### Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- Basic knowledge of Markdown
- Familiarity with Git and GitHub pull request workflow

### How to Contribute

You can contribute in several ways:

- Edit directly on GitHub.com or GitHub.dev (click the pencil icon on any file)
- Clone the repo locally and use your preferred workflow
- Use GitHub Desktop or another Git client

When creating your pull request, please describe:

- What changes you've made
- Why these changes are helpful
- Any related issues or considerations

### Making Changes

- All documentation is written in Markdown
- Use the Frontmatter section for metadata at the top of each Markdown file
- Place images in the appropriate subdirectory within the `/images` folder, and linked using relative paths (e.g. `../../images/orb-app/link-account.png`). This ensures that images are displayed correctly on GitHub and on the published site.
- When linking to other documentation pages, use absolute links without domain (e.g. `/docs/install-orb/ios`)). This ensures that links work on GitHub and on the published site.
- Follow the existing structure and style of the documentation
- New documentation should be created in the appropriate section folder
- Scripts are welcome, see the `/scripts` directory for examples
- Add a link to the new documentation in the relevant section of the navigation.md file
- Run `./validate-links.py` to check for broken links or images in the documentation

### Running the Documentation Preview Site

The preview site features:

- Live reloading when you edit documentation files
- Navigation sidebar matching the main website
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Table of Contents generation for articles
- Proper link handling for internal documentation links

### Scripts

- the `/scripts` directory contains scripts for installing & configuring Orb on various platforms. If you are adding a new script, please ensure it follows the same structure and is tested on the respective platform.
